# motion
Motion is a typical social media app. Like with Facebook or Twitter, you have the ability to create a profile, post text or pictures on a timeline, add friends etc. The web app is created using a template provided from propulsion academy.

The Project repository was done on Propulsions own instance of GitLab, thats why there are all the gitlab files for the CI/CD and Docker config.
